## Qualifying Pitches
**3:00 - 5:00pm, Main Stage**

* 2 minutes, **hard stop**
* 1 minute Q + A
* Bring your laptop or phone to demo
* We recommend practicing your pitch. Cut out any fluff.
* Arrive to stand in line at least 5 minutes before your scheduled start time.
* Ensure that your demo is ready & working; you will not get another chance.
* Got slides? Sure, that's ok. But likely only working prototypes will advance you to the next round


Review where you are on the schedule here: **Posted at 2:00pm**

We are using the US Navy Observatory Master Clock for time. If you're on a Mac, you should be synced to this, but it's worth verifying to make sure:

Note that the top 6 teams are contending for the *overall* hackathon winers. API sponsors may opt to select winners outside of this top 6.
