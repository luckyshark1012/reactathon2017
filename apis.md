# OpenTable
#### Quick Description
OpenTable is a leading marketplace for restaurants and diners. We love creating amazing dining experiences and we are expanding globally and across the dining space.

### Purpose
OpenTable’s public API is a means to search for restaurants, availability slots, make reservations, modify or cancel reservations. There are two key forms of public API:

##### REST API endpoint:
A more comprehensive API supporting all features required for interacting with OpenTable.

##### Graph QL endpoint (Alpha):
A work in progress endpoint that provides information on restaurants, cuisines, offers etc. Transaction level capabilities are not yet available at this endpoint.

### Challenge
We are looking for creative ideas and prototypes that are built using React family of technologies leveraging the public APIs thereby providing or enhancing the value for our diners.

# Netlify
#### Quick Description
Netlify is a git-centric workflow for the modern developer. Netlify provides CDN, Continuos Integration, [Continuous Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/), [1-click HTTPS](https://www.netlify.com/docs/ssl/), and [Custom Domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/).

### Purpose
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) are user experiences that are fast, secure, and engaging. Netlify helps you get there with our asset optimization and free SSL integration. 

Netlify improves your workflow with Deploy Previews that work by deploying every pull request from your git repository to a unique URL; completely different from the one your main site uses. You and your team can see how those changes look before they’re merged into the main branch and deployed to production.

To help you discover Deploy Previews, we put those links where it helps your team the most, directly in the pull request as commit statuses:

![](https://cdn.netlify.com/4d4d418736774eaea776b4ab08ee07af4a0bc5a9/c6be8/img/blog/deploy-preview-success.png)

We keep this preview up to date as you continue to work, committing new changes to the same branch. Our CDN takes care of invalidating the cache every time for you.

### Challenge
We are looking for the most interesting apps leveraging the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and have a high [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) rating on Google's [Lighthouse](https://jamstack.org/). All projects considered will need to be deployed to Netlify and with [Deploy Previews](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) enabled.
