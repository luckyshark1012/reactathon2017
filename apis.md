# OpenTable
#### Quick Description
OpenTable is a leading marketplace for restaurants and diners. We love creating amazing dining experiences and we are expanding globally and across the dining space.

### Purpose
OpenTable’s public API is a means to search for restaurants, availability slots, make reservations, modify or cancel reservations. There are two key forms of public API:

##### REST API endpoint:
A more comprehensive API supporting all features required for interacting with OpenTable.

##### Graph QL endpoint (Alpha):
A work in progress endpoint that provides information on restaurants, cuisines, offers etc. Transaction level capabilities are not yet available at this endpoint.

### Challenge
We are looking for creative ideas and prototypes that are built using React family of technologies leveraging the public APIs thereby providing or enhancing the value for our diners.
